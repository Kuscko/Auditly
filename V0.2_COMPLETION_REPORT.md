- ✅ Evidence versioning and historical tracking
- ✅ Chain of custody with timestamps

---

## ✅ BONUS: Evidence Lifecycle Management (100% Complete)

### Evidence Versioning & History ✅
- ✅ Track evidence changes over time (version table)
- ✅ Store evidence snapshots during collection
- ✅ Compare versions to detect configuration drift
- ✅ Automatic version creation on evidence persistence

### Staleness Detection ✅
- ✅ Detect evidence older than configurable threshold
- ✅ Calculate evidence age in days
- ✅ Flag evidence needing recollection
- ✅ Per-evidence-type staleness rules support

### Deduplication ✅
- ✅ Detect duplicate evidence by SHA256 hash
- ✅ Cross-system duplicate detection
- ✅ Version-based deduplication support

### Access Audit & Chain of Custody ✅
- ✅ Evidence access logging (who, what, when)

- ✅ IP address and action tracking
- ✅ Audit trail retrieval API
- ✅ 8 comprehensive lifecycle tests

## ⏸️ Weeks 9-10: Frameworks & Packaging (DEFERRED to v0.3)

Per the v0.3 roadmap, these items are explicitly deferred:

### Control Catalogs (Deferred)
- ⏸️ HIPAA catalog integration → v0.3
- ⏸️ PCI DSS catalog integration → v0.3
- ⏸️ ISO 27001 catalog integration → v0.3
- Note: NIST 800-53 Rev 5 and FedRAMP Moderate already supported

### Reporting & Export (Deferred)
- ⏸️ POA&M export from findings → v0.3
- ⏸️ Enhanced compliance reporting → v0.3
- Note: Basic readiness, engineer, and auditor reports already implemented

### Deployment (Deferred)
- ⏸️ Helm charts for Kubernetes → v0.3
- ⏸️ Docker containerization → v0.3
- Note: API and scheduler can run standalone with existing setup
